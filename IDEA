  Example: 2pi - svec

------------------------------

FACTOR 1.0 0.0
BEGINTRACE
LIGHT t0 t0
MOM p0
GAMMA muPi
LIGHT t0 t
GAMMA muVec
LIGHTBAR t t0
GAMMA muPi
MOM p1
ENDTRACE


Comment:
- The parameters will be parsed from the command line or from a params input file
- LIGHT is the light quark perambulator
- LIGHTBAR = G5 DAGGER(LIGHT) G5  *with time coordinates swapped*
  In this convention of coordinates we can replace LIGHTBAR with LIGHT without need to change
  parameters.  The difference (for exact solves) for LIGHT and LIGHTBAR should only exist
  with regard to on which source time-slices the propagator was inverted.

  Example: 2pi - lvec

------------------------------

FACTOR 1.0 0.0
BEGINTRACE
LIGHT t0 t0
MOM p0
GAMMA muPi
LIGHT_LGAMMA_LIGHT t0 t muVec t0
GAMMA muPi
MOM p1
ENDTRACE


Comments:
- LIGHT_LGAMMA_LIGHT t0 t mu t1
  is the local mu-operator insertion at time t with attached perambulators from t0 and back to t1

Comments:
- The above should suffice also for the 2pi - 2pi cases with multiple trace terms and multiple
  diagrams written as

  FACTOR ...
  BEGINTRACE
  ...
  ENDTRACE
  BEGINTRACE
  ...
  ENDTRACE

  FACTOR ...
  BEGINTRACE
  ...
  BEGINTRACE

- The parameters provided for t0, t, mu, ... should be provided in tuples.
  One way to do this is to use the "Params" class and to have a file as

   precision=0  # sloppy
   input[0]=fileA.dat  # contains perambs etc. for this config
   input[1]=fileB.dat
   contractions[0]=contrFile0.dat  # contains instructions as described above in text format
   t0[0]=0
   t[0]=0
   mu[0]=0
   t0[1]=0
   t[1]=1
   mu[1]=0

   All of these results should be written to a results correlator independently.  There
   should be another program that averages them and does the AMA correction.  The idea
   of the multiple parameters is to allow for cache re-use of loaded perambulators etc.
